    question: "Do I need a laptop to do the course?",
    answer:
      "A Laptop is mandatory to do the course. This is primarily because all your projects are industry-level and you would be able to do those projects only on a Laptop.",

    question: "How will the Placement Assurance work?",
    answer:
      "On successful completion of course, our placements team will ensure that you apply to 10 partnered jobs per week. This will help you crack up to 10 assured interviews over 6-10 months (or before, depending on your portfolio and Resume). Our placements team increases the number of interviews granted per candidate only on a case-by-case scenario if need be.",

    question: "What is the duration of this course?",
    answer: "This 5â€“7 month program is available in both offline classroom and online batches. The Digital Marketing Graduate Program (DMGP) is a 5 month program because you only get 2 out of 3 specialisations in the same. On the other hand the ADMIPP (Advanced Digital Marketing Industry proficiency Program) is 7 months long due to all specialisations being present in the same. We will also share a detailed program calendar with you post your Admission.",
